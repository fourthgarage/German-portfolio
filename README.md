# Project 1: Diabetes Prediction: Project Overview
* loaded Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle.
* Visualized and analyzed the data, plotted a pairwise dependencies.
* Fitted the model: Implemented a logistic regression algorithm. The error was minimized using gradient descent algorithm.
* Plotted ROC AUC curve, valuated model by precision and recall. Then plotted dependence of precision and recall on the threshold
* Chose a threshold of 0.36 for logistic regression, because the problem is from medical field and I was trying to maximize recall
* AUC = 0.84, Precision = 0.69, Recall = 0.71
