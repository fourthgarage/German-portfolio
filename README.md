# Project 1: Diabetes Prediction: Project Overview
* Loaded Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle.
* Visualized and analyzed the data, plotted a pairwise dependencies.
* Fitted the model: Implemented a logistic regression algorithm. The error was minimized using gradient descent algorithm.
* Plotted ROC AUC curve, valuated model by precision and recall. Then plotted dependence of precision and recall on the threshold
* Chose a threshold of 0.36 for logistic regression, because the problem is from medical field and I was trying to maximize recall
* AUC = 0.84, Precision = 0.69, Recall = 0.71

# [Project 2: Analysis of electronic store sales: Project Overview](https://github.com/fourthgarage/data-science-and-fried-peaches/tree/analysis-of-electronics-store-sales)
* Merged 12 months sales data into one csv-file and answered the questions:
* What's the best selling month? How much profit was this month?
* Which city had the most sales?
* What is the best time to advertise to sell better?
* What are the best selling product combinations?
* What is the best selling product and why?
